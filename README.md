# Background
Traditional crowdfunding platforms often lack transparency and fair compensation for both creators and backers. StarkRaise leverages blockchain to ensure secure and transparent funding processes, enhancing user trust and participation.

# Problem
Creators on traditional crowdfunding platforms face challenges in receiving fair support for their projects, leading to a lack of motivation for pursuing creative endeavors. Moreover, these platforms often suffer from issues related to data privacy, centralization, and lack of transparency, which undermine creator trust and participation.

# Objectives

### Fair Support
 Create a crowdfunding platform where creators receive fair support and donations for their projects.
Decentralization: Leverage blockchain technology to ensure transparency, data security, and creator control over funds and decisions.
### Community Engagement
 Foster a vibrant and engaged community where creator projects are valued and supported.
### Governance
 Implement decentralized governance to allow community members to participate in decision-making processes.

# Proposed Solution
StarkRaise aims to address these issues by building a decentralized crowdfunding platform on StarkNet, where creators can receive donations and support for their projects. This platform will prioritize fair support, data privacy, and community governance.

# Key Features

### Project Support

### Fund Distribution Transparency
 A portion of the platform's revenue is distributed to creators based on their project support levels.
### Privacy and Security
The platform ensures data security and user privacy through decentralized identity solutions and blockchain technology.
Impact
By addressing the limitations of traditional crowdfunding platforms, StarkRaise will empower creators by providing them with financial support, enhancing their opportunities, and fostering a transparent and secure funding environment.
